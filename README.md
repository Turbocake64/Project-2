# UO

UO is an app for people who need to keep track of the money they have lent and borrowed from friends and family. 

The UO motto is: Keep your friends | Keep your money. Our concept is dedicated to making sure that borrowers are held accountable for the money that they owe while allowing lenders to avoid the stress and discomfort of bringing up money issues with people in your personal life.

With it's in app notifications, automated emails, open transaction logs, and balance tracker, UO makes money easy and objective.


## How to use:

When the user loads the UO app, they are prompted to sign or log in. After signing in or making an account, the user will be redirected to their personal page where they may set a profile picture. In the UO app, each user can play two roles: a borrower and a lender. Only lenders can create a log for new transactions. They will do so by designating a current UO user via their email, setting a due date, the ammount borrowed, and a personal message if they choose. Every new transaction must be accepted by the borrower, should they not accept a transaction, it does not exist. 

Every new transaction is logged as a net positive toward the lender's balance and a net negative toward the borrower's. It will show up on their respective pages as an open transaction until the time it is paid. If a borrower logs a transaction as paid, the lender will be notified to confirm that the payment has indeed been made. If they do not confirm, the transaction remains open. If they do confirm, it no longer adds toward or against the balance of either user and is moved to a list of viewavble closed transaction for each user. 

Throughout each step of the communication, users are sent in app notifications and real world emails to create evidence of the agreement between them. Lenders may also send reminder emails of debts to borrowers via the app.

The reasoning here is two fold: 

1) To keep a record of the transaction for both parties
2) To remove the user from the uncomfortable social implications of following up about money.

## Future Development:

In the future we hope to create a system for rating users as borrowers based on their record of paying debts by or before the designated due date. We additionally would like to add the possbility to add an interest rate to a transaction once the due date lapses.

A separate option we would like to impliment in the future would be the ablity to make friends within the group so you can search by name instead of by email. This would allow for people to set several borrowers to a single transaction as well.

Finally, we hope to be able to tie user login to venmo or paypal so the trackers in the app are more directly linked to real world transactions.

## Feedback:

This was our second group project. A more complex and involved app than our respective first projects, frontloading the conceptualization, UI, and relationship between moving parts was the key to bringing UO together in 7 days time. Our team was dedicated, cooperative, and quick to learn new technology for the sake of the app. We did an effective job of dividing tasks so that everyone could work independently without waiting on someone else. 

We enjoyed the team dynamic, seeing how others conceptualized and executed ideas, and collaborating to achieve a shared vision. The biggest learning curve for our team was independently studying technologies to build sections of the app and then teaching them to our team members so everyone had a strong vision of the project. It was exciting to see our app come together and it would be a pleasure to work with this team in the future.
